[Dumbfounded?](https://dumbfounded.netlify.app) is an application that allows you to relax, have fun and get smarter! There are 3 different ways you can choose from how to play. For local game on cozy Friday evening when all the friends have gathered together, there is a great choice of "Local game", it allows you to play with up to 4 friends, each taking their turn. On the other hand, you can always play alone, choose the topic and diffulty level. Altogether there are 5 different topics that you can choose from: "Animals", "Science and Nature", "History", "Sports" and lastly "General Knowledge". But what about Tuesday evenings when all friends are in their own homes but you still want to spend time together by trying to beat each other with quiz scores??? Well, you can choose to play in an online room, having the same questions and seeing who comes up with the highest score. And, if you feel confident enough, you can take up a challenge and tackle the questions in a "Ranking game" with wide range questions about everything and anything on hard level, go ahead and enjoy!
