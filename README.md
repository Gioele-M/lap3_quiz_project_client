For local game on cozy Friday evening when all the friends have gathered together, there is a great choice of "Local game", it allows you to play with up to 4 friends, each taking their turn. On the other hand, you can always play alone, choose the topic and diffulty level. Altogether there are 5 different topics that you can choose from: "Animals", "Science and Nature", "History", "Sports" and lastly "General Knowledge".
